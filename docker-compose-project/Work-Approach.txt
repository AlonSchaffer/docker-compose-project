My work approach:
1. learn doecker:
    - diffrances between container and image 
    - how to deploy and remove containers
    - creating basic images
2. learn docker- compose
    - capabilities
    - configurations

3. learn posgres image at docker - compose:
    - know configurations and enviroment variables
    - learn how to add database to instances
    - learn how to change database to read only mode.

4. learn pgadmin image at docker-compose:
    - configurations
    - enviroment variables 
    - learn how to add pre configured connections

output should be :
3 containers:
1. pgadmin container
2. postgres container with two ro databases
3. posgres container with rw database
* connections in pgadmin for both containers
